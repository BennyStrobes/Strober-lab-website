**Modeling the context-specificity of genetic regulation of gene expresssion**

{% capture col1 %}

Genetic variants significantly associated with gene expression are known as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). eQTLs are a widely used approach to study the genetic regulation of gene expression and can also be used to infer the biological mechanisms and causal genes underlying disease-associated genetic variants. Dr. Strober has led several projects characterizing how eQTLs vary across tissues and cellular contexts. This includes work demonstrating that eQTLs are highly dynamic statistical associations that change continuously during process such as cellular differentiation ([Strober*, Elorbany*, Rhodes* et al. Science 2019](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31249060/). He also developed a probabilistic model, SURGE, to identify highly context-specific eQTLs from single-cell RNA sequencing using latent-factor models ([Strober et al. Genome Biology 2024](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-023-03152-z). Together, these studies demonstrated that genetic regulation of gene expression is highly dynamic and depends on cellular context.
