# {% include icon.html icon="fa-solid fa-users" %}Team

Weâ€™ve just opened the doors to our new lab and are excited to build a highly collaborative research team. We believe that diversity drives better research, and we aim to foster an environment where all members are treated equitably, respected, and valued for their differences.

We are actively hiring and welcome scientists from all backgrounds and career stages to join our team! As a new and growing lab, we offer close mentorship, frequent feedback, and strong collaborations with larger groups across the Harvard Medical School research community.
