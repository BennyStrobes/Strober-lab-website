# {% include icon.html icon="fa-solid fa-users" %}Team

Weâ€™ve just opened the doors to our new lab and are excited to build a highly collaborative research team. We believe that diversity drives better science, and we aim to build a group that brings together a wide range of expertise and backgrounds.

We are actively hiring and welcome scientists from all backgrounds and career stages to join our team! As a new and growing lab, we offer close mentorship and frequent feedback. At the same time, our strong collaborations with larger groups across the Harvard Medical School research community provide exposure to diverse research expertise and networks.
