**Our main goal is to provide rigorous training in computational science**, with an emphasis on the development and/or application of statistical and machine learning methods in human genetics and genomics. Training is supported through group meetings, individualized mentoring, and a collaborative lab environment.


### Postdoctoral Researchers

There are two options:

1. [Email me](mailto:ben.strober@childrens.harvard.edu) with a description of your research, a CV, and a sample publication.

2. If you are a US citizen or resident, you can apply to this CHIP program: [Postdoctoral Training in Informatics, Genomics, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Biomedical Data Science](https://www.chip.org/training/postdoctoral-training-ai-and-genomics). It is best to contact me beforehand to discuss.

### PhD Students

Current Harvard/MIT students: [email me](mailto:ben.strober@childrens.harvard.edu) with a description of your research interests and a CV.

Prospective students consider these programs:

1. [Harvard Medical School BIG PhD Track](https://dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/education/phd-program/big-phd-track)
2. [Harvard Medical School AI in Medicine PhD Track](https://dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/education/phd-program/ai-medicine-phd-track)
